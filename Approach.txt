Breaking it down, WAR:
- cards -> class
    - number value
    - suit and value (spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs) #done
- deck -> class (52 cards)
    -holds the cards : array of cards #done
- two players
    - hold cards -> array of cards #done

    - take turn putting top card of deck in the middle to compare -> if statement

    - if player 1 card is higher, player 1 wins and gets the card

    -else if player 2 card is higher, player 2 wins and gets the card

    - else, it's a tie and both players go to war
    
    - logic for war ( each player puts 3 cards face down on the table, and then puts 1 card face up and compare the 4th cards with if statement)
    - what happens with cards that are won? bottom of array (cards in hand)? or in another array, then when no more cards in hand, shuffle and add to hand? #done

-shuffle cards -> there's an array,so randomly sort it. #done
